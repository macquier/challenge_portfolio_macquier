<1>Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?<1>

My history with testing started with *a basic course in testing* after I decided to explore a new area for me in order to change my field of work later on. 


I had been writing tests on Selenium for a while, and I liked it so much that when I saw the challenge advertised, I immediately filled out an application form. :innocent:

My goal is to deepen my knowledge of test automation and learn the basics of the Phyton language. 
I look forward to interesting assignments that will help me improve my knowledge of testing. :sweat_smile:

**I hope that it will all work out for me!** :brooding_emoji:
